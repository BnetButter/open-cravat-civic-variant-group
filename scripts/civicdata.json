ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.","gene_id":1,"type":"variant","variant_types":[{"id":120,"name":"transcript_fusion","display_name":"Transcript Fusion","so_id":"SO:0001886","description":"A feature fusion where the deletion brings together transcript regions.","url":"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001886","root_concept":{"so_id":"SO:0001060","name":"Sequence Variant"}}],"civic_actionability_score":648.0,"flagged":false,"updated_at":"2021-04-07T18:03:23.864Z","coordinates":{"chromosome":"2","start":29415640,"stop":29446394,"reference_bases":null,"variant_bases":null,"representative_transcript":"ENST00000389048.3","chromosome2":null,"start2":null,"stop2":null,"representative_transcript2":null,"ensembl_version":75,"reference_build":"GRCh37"}},{"id":500,"entrez_name":"ALK","entrez_id":238,"name":"EML4::ALK e20-e20","description":"EML4-ALK variant 2 consists of a fusion of the ALK kinase domain (exons 20-29) with EML4 exons 1-20.

The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the coiled coil domain from BCR and the JH1 kinase domain from JAK2. Depending on the breakpoint variant, the fusion protein may also contain the JAK2 JH2 pseudokinase domain. In pre-clinical studies, the coiled coil domain of BCR has been shown to mediate oligomeric activation of the JAK2 kinase domain, thereby promoting downstream signaling by signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs).

As a prognostic marker, the fusion appears to be associated with high-risk disease in pediatric and adult populations. As a predictive marker, patients whose diseases exhibit the BCR-JAK2 fusion have experienced partial responses or even complete remission with hydroxyurea and/or interferon alfa. Case reports have demonstrated the limited utility of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response. Third generation ABL1 inhibitor ponatinib is the only FDA approved drug with activity against T315I . However due to risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels ponatinib is ONLY approved for T315I-positive CML or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL or in cases of CML, Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to other approved ABL1 inhibitors.","gene_id":4,"type":"variant","variant_types":[{"id":120,"name":"transcript_fusion","display_name":"Transcript Fusion","so_id":"SO:0001886","description":"A feature fusion where the deletion brings together transcript regions.","url":"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001886","root_concept":{"so_id":"SO:0001060","name":"Sequence Variant"}}],"civic_actionability_score":255.5,"flagged":false,"updated_at":"2022-03-10T22:27:25.538Z","coordinates":{"chromosome":"22","start":23522397,"stop":23632600,"reference_bases":null,"variant_bases":null,"representative_transcript":"ENST00000305877.8","chromosome2":"9","start2":133729451,"stop2":133763063,"representative_transcript2":"ENST00000318560.5","ensembl_version":75,"reference_build":"GRCh37"}},{"id":2575,"entrez_name":"ABL1","entrez_id":25,"name":"ETV6::ABL1","description":"","gene_id":4,"type":"variant","variant_types":[{"id":120,"name":"transcript_fusion","display_name":"Transcript Fusion","so_id":"SO:0001886","description":"A feature fusion where the deletion brings together transcript regions.","url":"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001886","root_concept":{"so_id":"SO:0001060","name":"Sequence Variant"}}],"civic_actionability_score":12.5,"flagged":false,"updated_at":"2022-03-11T04:01:37.734Z","coordinates":{"chromosome":null,"start":null,"stop":null,"reference_bases":null,"variant_bases":null,"representative_transcript":null,"chromosome2":null,"start2":null,"stop2":null,"representative_transcript2":null,"ensembl_version":null,"reference_build":null}},{"id":2660,"entrez_name":"ABL1","entrez_id":25,"name":"NUP214::ABL1","description":"The NUP214 -ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the NUP214 (Nucleoporin 214) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 34 of NUP214 to exon 2 of ABL1 (NUP214-ABL1 34-2). In T-ALL, the fusion is typically expressed from amplified extrachromosomal bodies (episomes) that arise when the genomic region from ABL1 to NUP214 circularizes to generate the NUP214-ABL1 fusion. In B-ALL, the fusion commonly results from an intrachromosomal duplication involving chromosome 9, with breakpoints within the NUP214 and ABL1 genes. The fusion has been identified in 6% of cases of T-lymphoblastic leukemia and rare cases of B-lymphoblastic leukemia by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, single nucleotide polymorphism array, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and fluorescence in situ hybridization targeting the ABL1 gene. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the WD40 repeat and coiled-coil domains of NUP214 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and MAPK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways.

Dasatinib was then prescribed and follow-up information is available for the older child, who successfully achieved a complete response for three months before succumbing to the disease.
